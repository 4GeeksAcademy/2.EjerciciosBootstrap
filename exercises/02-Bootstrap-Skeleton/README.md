# `02` Bootstrap Skeleton

If you want to import Bootstrap to your website, you can use this public URL that is available to everybody:

```html
 <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0-beta.2/css/bootstrap.min.css">

```


When using Bootstrap, you have to wrap all of your content within the following **container** classes:

```html
<div class="container"></div>
```
OR
```html
<div class="container-fluid"></div>
```


## 📝 Instructions:


1. Link the Bootstrap CSS Stylesheet with the document using the **link** tag.
2. Wrap the content of the website within a div with a **container** class.
3. Run the exercise and compare the differences.
4. Now change the class of the main div to **container-fluid**.
5. Run the exercise and compare the difference.


## 💡Hint:

To understand the difference between both **container** classes, you have to make the demo container (the blue one, on the bottom left of the screen) bigger.
