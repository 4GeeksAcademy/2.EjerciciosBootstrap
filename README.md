My name is Alejandro Sanchez [@alesanchezr](https://twitter.com/alesanchezr). I'm really excited to have you here !! ðŸŽ‰ ðŸ˜‚
Learning to code is hard, you need coaching! DM me on twitter if you have any question.

# How are the exercises organized?

Each exercise is a small react application containing the following files:

1. **index.css:** your CSS code goes here.
2. **README.md:** contains exercise instructions.
3. **test.js:** you don't have to open this file, it contains the testing script for the exercise.
